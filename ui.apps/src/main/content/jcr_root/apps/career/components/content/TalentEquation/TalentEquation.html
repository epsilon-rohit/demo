<p>Publicis Groupe’s philosophy revolves around the equation :</p>

<p class="extra1a">( IQ + EQ + TQ )</p>

<p><br>
Intellectual Quotient, Technology Quotient and Emotional Quotient to power creativity and disruption.<br>
The talent we recruit has to score high on these elements:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Intellectual Quotient: </b> any approach to brand communication or product marketing requires serious thought and astute strategic counsel. Coupled with the need to transform a business model or marketing strategy, it’s led to the development of consulting as an activity in its own right. A strong IQ is therefore crucial to face the challenges of the Digital Age.</li>
	<li><b>Technology Quotient:</b> we know how to make the most of the unprecedented capabilities of new technologies.</li>
	<li><b>Emotional Quotient:</b> it’s the heart of our business and what makes us stand out. EQ, powered by creativity, ensures the success of the greatest alchemies, valorizing and transcending Publicis Groupe’s offer to bring a vital touch of humanity to our brand content.</li>
</ul>
